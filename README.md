# Estimation code for "Incorporating Time-Varying Covariates in a Simple Mixture Model for Discrete-Time Duration Data"

Pete Fader and Bruce Hardie provides a technical note <https://brucehardie.com/notes/037/> on incorporating time-varying covariates for a discrete-time duration mixture model.

However, a code on how to estimate such a model is not available.  

I created the MLE estimation code using R with simulated data.  

G+G_varying_MLE.R is the version that matches the technical note.  

G+G_static_MLE.R is a simpler version I first created for practice.  It is uploaded in this respostory nevertheless.
