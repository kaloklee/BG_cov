# Estimation code for "Incorporating Time-Varying Covariates in a Simple Mixture Model for Discrete-Time Duration Data"

Pete Fader and Bruce Hardie provides a technical note <https://brucehardie.com/notes/037/> on incorporating time-varying covariates for a discrete-time duration mixture model.

However, a code on how to estimate such a model is not available.  

I created the MLE estimation code using R with simulated data.
